## 📅 Recommended Target Lists (Curated by LeetCode)

These built-in study plans are excellent structured practice sets:

| **Plan**                     | **Coverage**                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Top Interview 150**        | Core list of 150 most common LeetCode problems for interviews (across arrays, linked lists, DP, graphs, etc.). ([LeetCode][1]) |
| **LeetCode 75**              | Lean essential list (~75 questions) balancing topics and difficulty. ([LeetCode][5])                                           |
| **Comprehensive Topic List** | Big organized list sorted by topics for focused practice. ([LeetCode][4])                                                      |

👉 Start with **LeetCode 75** if you want a compact but thorough set. Move to **Top Interview 150** as you get deeper. ([LeetCode][1])
