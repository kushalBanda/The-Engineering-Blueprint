## 📅 Suggested Study Order (Roadmap)

1. **Core First** (foundations most companies test early):

   * Arrays & Strings → Linked Lists → Hashing → Stacks/Queues
2. **Intermediate Patterns**:

   * Binary Search → Trees → Recursion/Backtracking → Heaps
3. **Advanced & Key Filters**:

   * Dynamic Programming → Graphs → Greedy
4. **Specialized Skills** (company-specific):

   * Tries, Union-Find, BIT/Segment Trees, Bit Manipulation ([GeeksforGeeks][2])

## 📌 High-ROI Problem Patterns to Master

These patterns apply across topics and drastically cut down learning time:

* Two Pointers / Sliding Window
* Fast & Slow Pointers
* DFS & BFS
* Divide & Conquer
* Memoization / DP States
* Greedy Choices
* Binary Search Variants
* Backtracking Templates ([LinkedIn][4])

## 🧠 How Many Problems to Practice Per Topic

| **Level** | **Problems/Topic** | **Goal**                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Beginner        | 20–30                   | Understand basics & typical edge cases |
| Intermediate    | 30–50                   | Solve medium problems reliably         |
| Advanced        | 20+                      | Tackle hard problems with explanation  |

---

## 🎯 Final Notes

* Prioritize core buckets (arrays, hashing, recursion, tree/graphs, DP) first — these appear most often in FAANG and product-based interviews. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])
* Once fundamentals are solid, tackle pattern-based sets — they generalize to unseen problems rapidly. ([LinkedIn][4])
* Track your speed and explain thought process — interviews test clarity almost as much as correctness.
