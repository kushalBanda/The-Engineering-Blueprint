## Functional Requirements

1. Users should be able to input a start location and a destination and get an estimated fare.
2. User should be able to request a ride based on an estimate
3. Drivers should be able to accept/deny a request and navigate to pickup/dropoff.

--- Out of Scope ---

- Multiple car types
- Rating for drivers and riders
- Schedule a ride in advance

### Non-functional requirements

- Low latency matching < 1 min to match or failure
- Consistency of matching, Ride to driver is 1:1
- Highly available outside the matching
- Handle high throughput, sruges for peak hours or special events, 100s of thousands of requests withing a given region

--- Out of Scope ---

- GDPR user privacy
- Resilienc and handling system failure
- Monitoring, logging, alerting etc..
- CI/CD pipeline
