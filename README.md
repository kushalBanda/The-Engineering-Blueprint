## ☁️ System Design

Architectural breakdowns of complex distributed systems, focusing on scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

### 🚗 **[Design Uber](./SystemDesign/Breakdown/Uber/designUber.md)**
A comprehensive analysis of a ride-sharing platform.
- **Core Requirement:** Real-time driver matching & location tracking.
- **Key Constraints:** Low latency, high consistency, heavy write throughput.
- **Diagrams:** High-level architecture, database schema, and component interactions.

---

## 📐 Design Patterns

Implementation of standard GoF design patterns to solve common software design problems.

### **Creational Patterns**
Mechanisms for object creation that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **[Factory Method](./DesignPatterns/Creational/Factory/Readme.md):**  Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **[Singleton](./DesignPatterns/Creational/Singleton/Readme.md):** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
